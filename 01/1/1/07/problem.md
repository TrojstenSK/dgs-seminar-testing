Since we started writing astrophysics tutorial handouts and homework papers,
and since we added NÃ¡boj chemistry to the portfolio, writing chemical formulae and reactions
is also crucial. For instance
$${
    \ce{2 H2 + O2 &-> H2O}, \\
    \ce{2 H2SO4 &<=> H3SO4+ + HSO4-}, \\
    \ce{[B4H9]- + BBr3 &-> B4H8 + HBBr3-}.
}$$

We also provide a macro for nuclides, such as
$$
    \Nuclide[235][92]{U}
$$
